# Libft

### Description

Some re coded functions from *libc*.
The purpose of this project was to re code a lot of basics functions from libc
such as strcmp, memdel, itoa, strsplit, etc.. And then create our owm library
with all those function.

### Use it

You can compile it using :
```
make
```
Then you can just ad it as a library in your compilation line

### What I learned

- What a library is and how to create it
- How to create and use a makefile
- How computers memory is working
- How to use lists

Not a really fun project but really improved my understanding of the C language
and I learned how to write clean code.
